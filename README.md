This is a simple implementation of Conway's game of life.

You can chose the width of the grid with --width (default 50), the height of the grid with --height (default 50),
the number of generations to be displayed with --generations (default infinite) and the speed at which the steps are displayed in hertz with --speed 
(default 5).
